  x11 ones... x11, xrandr, xcb*).

`sudo apt-get install cmake libflac-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libjpeg8-dev libfreetype6-dev libudev-dev libraspberrypi-dev`

**Step 2:** Build SFML-Pi

- From the source directory for sfml-pi, run cmake with the '-DSFML_RPI=1' parameter.
- Once cmake runs successfully, compile using 'sudo make install' and then 'sudo ldconfig'
- The commands should look something like this:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DSFML_RPI=1 -DSFML_OS_LINUX=1 -DSFML_OPENGL_ES=1 -DEGL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include  -DEGL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libEGL.so -DGLES_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include  -DGLES_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libGLESv2.so
